# Face mask detection with Tensorflow CNNs


COVID-19 has been an inspiration for many software and data engineers during the last months. This project demonstrates how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can detect if a person in a picture is wearing a face mask or not. As you can easily understand the applications of this method may be very helpful for the prevention and the control of COVID-19 as it could be used in public places like airports, shopping malls etc.
